## Project Descriptions
Dice Challenge
In the Dice Challenge project, participants use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple yet entertaining dice game. 
Two players roll their respective dice with the click of a button; the player with the higher roll wins. 
This project serves as an excellent introduction to DOM manipulation and random number generation in JavaScript.

Drum Kit
The Drum Kit project lets users create their own rhythms and beats using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application features a visual drum set where different drum sounds are triggered by 
keyboard presses or clicking on the drum tiles. This project offers hands-on experience in event handling and audio manipulation in web development.
