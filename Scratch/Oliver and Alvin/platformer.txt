1. resize sprite and initialize when clicked 

2. create floor by creating a new sprite and filling it with a color 
	- 1 box for soil
	- 1 smaller box for grass
	- set location x: 0 y: 0 
	- add sky backdrop

3. player movement  & collision 
	- rename player and background 

	- ** Forever loop and declare  
		Create block // up down movement with 2 arguements : height and fall speed. 

	- add functionality to the fall function 

4. JUMP [7:00 start]
	- new if else 
	- if not() and key up pressed 
		jump
	else	
		dont jump

	- set jump to 10

5.  LEFT RIGHT [8:58 ] 

	CREATE NEW block left/right with 2 arguments speed and drag

	- copy paste jump logic
	- create an x=speed variable 
	- we want x to change not y so we
		1. change by x-speed (under define)
		2. repeat ceiling of abs of x-speed
		3. remove if else that checks for jump
		4. change to just an if 
		5. set x-speed to 0 
	
		MOVE LEFT OR RIGHT 
		6. add if else
		if(right){
			point front
		}
		else{
			if(left){
			point left}
		}
